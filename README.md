# multisort-ux

## Introduction

If you have to narrow your search to find candidate that best meets certain number of criteria your best approach would be to put all of them in the table then sort them in ascending or ascending order by each given criteria.

Simple example would be choosing a place for rent.
If for example you have a table with thousands of rows and each row has information about:

 - floor space
 - distance
 - price
 - number of tennants
 - pets allowed

All of these things are important but some of them are more important then others and they are different for each of us. My girlfriend don't like to travel, so distance is a key, but I love my dog thus pets allowed come to first place! (don't worry filtering is coming soon).

Of course, you are getting how this is useful but real challenge is how to make these tables easy to grasp at a glance and intuitive to use.
